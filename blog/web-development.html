            <h1> web development</h1>
            <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
            <p>1. Web development is the work involved in developing a website for the Internet (World Wide Web) or an intranet (a private network). Web development can range from developing a simple single static page of plain text to complex web applications, electronic businesses, and social network services. A more comprehensive list of tasks to which Web development commonly refers, may include Web engineering, Web design, Web content development, client liaison, client-side/server-side scripting, Web server and network security configuration, and e-commerce development.</p>
            <p>2. Among Web professionals, "Web development" usually refers to the main non-design aspects of building Web sites: writing markup and coding.Web development may use content management systems (CMS) to make content changes easier and available with basic technical skills.</p>
            <p>For larger organizations and businesses, Web development teams can consist of hundreds of people (Web developers) and follow standard methods like Agile methodologies while developing Web sites. Smaller organizations may only require a single permanent or contracting developer, or secondary assignment to related job positions such as a graphic designer or information systems technician. Web development may be a collaborative effort between departments rather than the domain of a designated department. There are three kinds of Web developer specialization: front-end developer, back-end developer, and full-stack developer.[3] Front-end developers are responsible for behavior and visuals that run in the user browser, while back-end developers deal with the servers. Since the commercialization of the Web with Tim Berners-Lee[4] developing the World Wide Web at CERN, the industry has boomed and has become one of the most used technologies ever.</p>

            <h2 id="web-design">web-designing</h2>

            <p>Web design encompasses many different skills and disciplines in the production and maintenance of websites. The different areas of web design include web graphic design; user interface design (UI design); authoring, including standardised code and proprietary software; user experience design (UX design); and search engine optimization. Often many individuals will work in teams covering different aspects of the design process, although some designers will cover them all.[1] The term "web design" is normally used to describe the design process relating to the front-end (client side) design of a website including writing markup. Web design partially overlaps web engineering in the broader scope of web development. Web designers are expected to have an awareness of usability and be up to date with web accessibility guidelines.</p>

            <h2 id="web-dev">web-development-tools</h2>
                <p>Web development tools (often called devtools or inspect element) allow web developers to test and debug their code. They are different from website builders and integrated development environments (IDEs) in that they do not assist in the direct creation of a webpage, rather they are tools used for testing the user interface of a website or web application.</p>
                <p>Web development tools come as browser add-ons or built-in features in web browsers. Most popular web browsers, such as Google Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, Safari, Microsoft Edge and Opera,[1] have built-in tools to help web developers, and many additional add-ons can be found in their respective plugin download centers.</p>
                <p>Web development tools allow developers to work with a variety of web technologies, including HTML, CSS, the DOM, JavaScript, and other components that are handled by the web browser. Due to increasing demand from web browsers to do more,[2] popular web browsers have included more features geared for developers.[3]</p>

                <h2 id="web-developer">web-developer</h2>
                <p>A web developer is a programmer who develops World Wide Web applications using a clientâ€“server model. The applications typically use HTML, CSS and JavaScript in the client, PHP, ASP.NET (C#), Python, Node.js, Go or Java in the server, and http for communications between client and server. A web developer may specialize in client-side applications (front-end developer), server-side applications (back-end developer), or both (full-stack developer).</p>
                <p>There are no formal educational or license requirements to become a web developer. However, many colleges and trade schools offer coursework in web development. There are also many tutorials and articles which teach web development, often freely available on the web - for example, on JavaScript.
                <h2>Prerequisite</h2>

                   <p> Even though there are no formal requirements, web development projects require web developers to have advanced knowledge and skills such as:</p>
                    
                 <p>1. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript[1]
                    Server/client side architecture like all or some of the above mentioned <br>
                   2. Programming/coding/scripting in one of the many server-side languages or frameworks (e.g., Perl, Python, Ruby, PHP, Go, Java, ASP.NET, Node.js) <br>
                   3. Ability to utilize a database <br>
                   4. Creating single page application with the use of front-end tools such as Vue,[2] React.js[3] or Angular[4]</p>
